# Flex Sensor with LCD Display Integration

This project integrates an Arduino Uno with a flex sensor and a 1602 LCD display to show the degree of bend on the screen. The flex sensor's resistance changes with bending, and this change is displayed on the LCD screen. The project aims to demonstrate how to interface a flex sensor with an Arduino and display the sensor data on an LCD screen.
